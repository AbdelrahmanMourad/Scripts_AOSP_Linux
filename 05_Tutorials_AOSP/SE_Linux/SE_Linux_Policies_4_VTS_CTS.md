Absolutely, Abdelrahman ‚Äî this is a great trio of topics because they sit right at the heart of Android‚Äôs  **security and compatibility model** . Let‚Äôs break them down clearly and connect the dots:

# üîíSELinux Policy, CTS, VTS

## üîí Android SELinux Policy

* **What it is** : Android uses **Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)** to enforce  **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** . Unlike traditional Linux discretionary access control, SELinux enforces strict rules:  *anything not explicitly allowed is denied* .
* **Why it matters** :
* Prevents even root/system processes from doing unauthorized actions.
* Sandboxes apps and system services.
* Reduces attack surface by confining daemons and HALs.
* **Modes** :
* *Permissive* : logs violations but doesn‚Äôt block them (used in development).
* *Enforcing* : blocks and logs violations (default in production).
* **Policy structure** :
* **Domains** : labels for processes (e.g., `system_server`, `netd`).
* **Types** : labels for objects (files, sockets, devices).
* **Rules** : define what domains can do with which types.
* **Practical example** : If you write a custom HAL or daemon, you must create a `.te` policy file to define its domain and what resources it can access. Otherwise, SELinux will block it.

## ‚úÖ Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)

* **What it is** : A **free, automated test suite** that ensures a device is  **Android-compatible** .
* **Who uses it** : Device manufacturers (OEMs) and developers who want their devices to pass Google‚Äôs compatibility requirements.
* **How it works** :
* Runs on a host machine, executes tests on a connected device/emulator.
* Tests APIs, permissions, intents, resources, and system behaviors.
* Includes **CTS Verifier (CTS-V)** for manual tests (e.g., sensors, cameras).
* **Why it matters** :
* Passing CTS is required for  **Google Mobile Services (GMS) certification** .
* Ensures apps from Play Store behave consistently across devices.

## üèóÔ∏è Vendor Test Suite (VTS)

* **What it is** : A test suite focused on the **vendor side** of Android (kernel, HALs, vendor libraries).
* **Why it exists** : Introduced with **Project Treble** (Android 8.0), which separated the Android framework from vendor implementations.
* **What it tests** :
* **HALs** (Hardware Abstraction Layers).
* **Kernel interfaces** (Linux selftests, LTP).
* **Vendor Native Development Kit (VNDK)** compliance.
* **ABI stability** between framework and vendor.
* **How it works** :
* Uses GTest (C++), JUnit (Java), and some Python tests.
* Runs on host machine, executes on device.
* Ensures vendor image is compatible with the system image.
* **Why it matters** :
* Makes Android updates faster and safer.
* Prevents vendor-specific changes from breaking framework updates.

## üß© How They Fit Together

* **SELinux** : Protects runtime security by enforcing strict policies.
* **CTS** : Ensures the **framework and APIs** behave consistently across devices.
* **VTS** : Ensures the **vendor implementation (HALs, kernel)** is stable and compatible with the framework.

Think of it like this:

* SELinux =  *Security guard at runtime* .
* CTS =  *Quality inspector for the Android framework* .
* VTS =  *Quality inspector for vendor hardware/software integration* .

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs go hands-on. I‚Äôll walk you through **(1) writing a simple SELinux policy for a custom daemon** and  **(2) running CTS/VTS on an AOSP build** .

# üîí Writing a Simple SELinux Policy for a Custom Daemon

### Scenario

Suppose you‚Äôve added a custom daemon `mydaemon` that needs to read/write `/dev/mydev0`.

### Steps

1. **Define a new type for the device**In `device.te`:

   ```c++
   // # te
   type mydev_device, dev_type;
   ```
2. **Define a domain for your daemon**In `mydaemon.te`:
   te

   ```c++
   // # te
   type mydaemon, domain;
   type mydaemon_exec, exec_type, file_type;

   init_daemon_domain(mydaemon)

   // # Allow daemon to access the device
   allow mydaemon mydev_device:chr_file rw_file_perms;
   ```
3. **Label the binary and device**In `file_contexts`:

   ```c++
   /system/bin/mydaemon     u:object_r:mydaemon_exec:s0
   /dev/mydev[0-9]*         u:object_r:mydev_device:s0
   ```
4. **Add init service entry**In `init.mydevice.rc`:

   ```c++
   service mydaemon /system/bin/mydaemon
       class main
       user system
       group system
       seclabel u:r:mydaemon:s0
   ```
5. **Build and test**

   * Rebuild AOSP with your new `.te` and `file_contexts`.
   * Boot device in **permissive mode** first (`setenforce 0`) to catch denials in logs (`adb logcat | grep avc`).
   * Refine policy until no denials remain.
   * Switch back to **enforcing mode** (`setenforce 1`).

# ‚úÖ Running CTS and VTS on AOSP

Both CTS and VTS use **Trade Federation (Tradefed)** as the harness.

### 1. Build the test packages

From your AOSP root:

```bash
# For CTS
make cts -j$(nproc)

# For VTS
make vts -j$(nproc)
```

### 2. Connect your device

* Enable **USB debugging** on the device.
* Verify with:

  ```bash
  adb devices
  ```

### 3. Run CTS

Start the CTS console:

```bash
cts-tradefed
```

Inside the console:

```bash
run cts --plan CTS
```

* Runs the full CTS plan.
* You can also run specific modules:

  ```bash
  run cts --module CtsGraphicsTestCases
  ```

### 4. Run VTS

Start the VTS console:

```bash
vts-tradefed
```

Inside the console:

```bash
run vts
```

* Runs the default VTS plan.
* You can target specific HAL tests:

  ```bash
  run vts --module VtsHalHealthV2_0Target
  ```

### 5. Results

* Logs and results are stored under:

  ```bash
  out/host/linux-x86/cts/results/
  out/host/linux-x86/vts/results/
  ```
* You‚Äôll find XML + zipped logs for submission or debugging.

# üß© Putting It Together

* **SELinux policy** : ensures your daemon runs securely.
* **CTS** : validates framework/API compatibility.
* **VTS** : validates vendor/HAL/kernel compliance.

This workflow is exactly what OEMs and integrators follow to ship Android devices with Google certification.
