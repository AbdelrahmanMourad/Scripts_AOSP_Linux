Perfect, Abdelrahman! Here's the expanded section for writing and auditing SELinux rules, continuing the same sandwich structure and multi-tiered explanation style. This will slot into your Markdown file seamlessly and help your students—from curious kids to seasoned professionals—grasp the full lifecycle of SELinux policy development.


# 🧾 Writing & Auditing SELinux Rules

## 🥪 Overview (Top Bread)

Writing SELinux rules is like setting up traffic signs for processes: who can go where, and what they can touch. Auditing helps you catch violations and refine those rules. This section covers:
- How to write `.te` rules
- Where to place them
- How to audit denials
- How to check if a rule already exists
- How to use existing types and macros

### ✍️ How to Write Rules

<details>
<summary>👶 For Kids</summary>
Rules are like stickers on toys: “Only red cars can go on the red track.” You write these stickers so everyone knows what’s allowed.
</details>
<details>
<summary>🧑 For Beginners</summary>

Rules are written in `.te` files using Type Enforcement syntax:

```bash
allow source_type target_type:class permission;
```
Example:
```bash
allow my_app my_data_file:file read;
```
Use macros to simplify:
```bash
r_dir_file(my_app, my_data_file)
```
Place rules in:
- **`system/sepolicy/private/`**: **Core AOSP rules**
- **`device/<vendor>/<board>/sepolicy/`**: **Device-specific rules**
- **`vendor/<vendor>/sepolicy/`**: **Vendor customizations**
</details>
<details>
<summary>👨‍💻 For Professionals</summary>

Use domain-specific `.te` files to define access:
- Prefer macros from `policy_macros` for readability and maintainability
- Avoid blanket `allow` rules—use `neverallow` to enforce boundaries
- Use `type_transition`, `typeattribute`, and `genfscon` for advanced control

Example:
```bash
type my_daemon, domain;
type my_socket, sock_file_type;
allow my_daemon self:process setexec;
allow my_daemon my_socket:sock_file write;
```

### 🔍 How to Audit SELinux Denials

- <details>
  <summary>👶 For Kids</summary>
  If someone breaks a rule, the teacher writes it down. You read the note to fix the rule.
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>🧑 For Beginners</summary>

  Use dmesg or logcat to find avc: denied messages:
  ```bash
  adb logcat | grep denied
  ```
  Use audit2allow to suggest fixes:
  ```bash
  audit2allow -w -a  # Explain why denied
  audit2allow -a     # Suggest rule
  ```
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>👨‍💻 For Professionals</summary>

  Use `sepolicy-analyze` to inspect domains:
  ```bash
  sepolicy-analyze /path/to/sepolicy permissive
  ```
  Use `checkpolicy` and `sepolicy_compile` to validate:
  ```bash
  m checkpolicy
  m sepolicy
  ```
  Use `neverallow` to enforce strict boundaries:
  ```bash
  neverallow untrusted_app system_file:file write;
  ```

#### 🧠 How to Know If a Rule Exists
  - <details>
    <summary>👶 For Kids</summary>
    Before making a new rule, check if someone already made it.
    </details>
  - <details>
    <summary>🧑 For Beginners</summary>
  
    Search existing `.te` files or use grep:
    ```bash
    grep -r "allow my_app" system/sepolicy/
    ```
    Check `policy_macros` for reusable macros:
    ```bash
    grep -r "r_dir_file" system/sepolicy/public/
    ```
    </details>
  - <details>
    <summary>👨‍💻 For Professionals</summary>
  
    Use **`apolicy`** or **`sepolicy-analyze`** to inspect compiled policies:
    ```bash
    apolicy --domain my_app
    ```
    Use **`sesearch`** to query rules:
    ```bash
    sesearch --allow -s my_app -t my_data_file -c file
    ```
    </details>

#### 🧰 How to Use Existing Rules
  - <details>
    <summary>👶 For Kids</summary>
    
    If the rule is already made, just follow it!
    </details>
  - <details>
    <summary>🧑 For Beginners</summary>
    
    - ***Use macros like:***
    ```bash
    r_dir_file(my_app, my_data_file)
    ```
    - ***Or reuse types:***
    ```bash
    allow my_app system_file:file read;
    ```
    - ***Place rules in:***
      - **`system/sepolicy/private/`**: **Core AOSP rules**
      - **`device/<vendor>/<board>/sepolicy/`**: **Device-specific rules**
      - **`vendor/<vendor>/sepolicy/`**: **Vendor customizations**
    </details>

    <summary>👨‍💻 For Professionals</summary>

    - Use domain-specific `.te` files to define access:
      - Prefer macros from `policy_macros` for readability and maintainability
      - Avoid blanket `allow` rules—use `neverallow` to enforce boundaries
      - Use `type_transition`, `typeattribute`, and `genfscon` for advanced control
    - Example:
    ```bash
    type my_daemon, domain;
    type my_socket, sock_file_type;
    allow my_daemon self:process setexec;
    allow my_daemon my_socket:sock_file write;
    ```

## 🥪 Conclusion (Bottom Bread)

- Writing SELinux rules is a disciplined process: observe, audit, write, validate, and enforce. Whether you're debugging denials or designing new domains, understanding the policy lifecycle is key to building secure Android systems.

- Would you like me to help you organize this into a GitHub repo structure with folders like `/docs`, `/examples`, and `/slides`, or generate a visual diagram for the workflows?
