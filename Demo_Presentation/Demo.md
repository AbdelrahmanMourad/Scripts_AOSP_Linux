Slide 1 – Title
----------------
The_Platform: AOSP-Based Future Automotive Platform
Subtitle: Modular milestones evolving into a full-stack solution

---

Slide 2 – Core GUI Layer (Milestone 1)
--------------------------------------
Problem: No unified place to control features  
Solution: Build a basic GUI container app to host all upcoming modules  
Impact: Enables early demos, easy future integration  

---

Slide 3 – Connectivity & Networking
-----------------------------------
Problem: Cars need modern comms (WiFi, BT, 4G/5G, V2X)  
Solution: Add Android connectivity stack, APIs for apps  
Impact: Essential for future services and OTA updates  

---

Slide 4 – GPIO Control & Vehicle IO
------------------------------------
Problem: No standard way to manage buttons, LEDs, seats, A/C, glass, etc.  
Solution: HAL + Service layer exposing GPIOs as APIs  
Impact: Foundation for vehicle control, safety demos  

---

Slide 5 – Audio & Multimedia
-----------------------------
Problem: Audio/video integration fragmented  
Solution: Android AudioFlinger + Video pipeline with custom extensions  
Impact: Infotainment readiness, hands-free, multimedia streaming  

---

Slide 6 – Safety & Security
----------------------------
Problem: No safety/security modules early on  
Solution: Build watchdog, driver monitoring hooks, secure comms  
Impact: Mandatory for compliance, user trust  

---

Slide 7 – Web & Cloud Services
-------------------------------
Problem: Cars lack cloud integration (maps, weather, backend)  
Solution: WebView + REST clients for remote services  
Impact: Early smart features, extendable  

---

Slide 8 – AI & Advanced Features
--------------------------------
Problem: Luxury/competitive features not ready in early phases  
Solution: AI-based driver assistance, voice agents, personalization  
Impact: Market differentiation, long-term value  

---

Slide 9 – Roadmap / Milestones
-------------------------------
- Milestone 1: Core GUI + Connectivity  
- Milestone 2: GPIO + Audio/Video  
- Milestone 3: Safety + Web Services  
- Milestone 4: AI & Advanced Features
