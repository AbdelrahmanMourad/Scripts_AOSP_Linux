#!/bin/bash
# The shebang (#!) at the top tells the system to use the Bash shell to interpret this script.
# It ensures your script runs with the correct shell, regardless of the user's default shell.
# This is important for compatibility and to avoid unexpected behavior if the script uses Bash-specific features.
# Always place the shebang as the very first line in your script.
