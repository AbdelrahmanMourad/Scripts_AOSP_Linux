| Tool                   | Scenario & Question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boot Failure** | **The device is stuck at the boot animation, and ADB is not available.**Detail your debugging process. What information would you try to extract using the**serial console**and where in the boot sequence (e.g.,`init`stages) would you focus?                                                                                     |
| **Boot Time**    | The overall boot time is acceptable, but there is a 10-second delay between the**init logo**and the start of the **boot animation** . Which tools ( **dmesg** , **logcat** , **systrace** ) would you use, and what files (e.g., **init.rc** ) would you examine to find the bottleneck?                      |
| **Performance**  | An embedded system is experiencing high, sustained**CPU usage**after running for an hour, which degrades user experience. How would you use**`perf`**or** `ftrace`**to identify the hot paths in both the**Kernel**and**Userspace**(Framework/HAL)?                                                                   |
| **HAL Crash**    | A**HAL service is crashing during startup**with a `Segmentation Fault`in `logcat`. The crash is within the native C++ code. What steps do you take to isolate the issue, and how do you use the resulting**tombstone file**to find the exact line of code and stack trace?                                                        |
| **App Startup**  | A pre-installed**System App**fails to launch, showing a blank screen then closing. The app runs fine on a vanilla AOSP build. What information do you seek in **`logcat`** , focusing on **PackageManager** , **Zygote** , and potential **SELinux denials** , to determine the cause?                            |
| **Cross-Layer**  | An application calls a Framework service API, which in turn calls your new Kernel driver. You suspect a data corruption issue occurs somewhere in the stack. How would you use a combination of**logcat** , **ftrace** , and**Kernel logging/debugging**to trace the data flow and pinpoint where the corruption is introduced? |
